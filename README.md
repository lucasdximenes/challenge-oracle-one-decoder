# Challenge Oracle ONE - Decoder

---

## Description

This is an application that encrypts and decrypts messages using the following techniques:

The encryption "keys" we will use are:

- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

The application must be able to encrypt and decrypt messages using the keys above.

- It should only work with lowercase letters
- No accented letters or special characters should be used
- It should be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version and also return an encrypted word to the original version.
